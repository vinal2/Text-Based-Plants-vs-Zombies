# Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by launching MainGui and pressing the play button
    that loads in the base level, adding 2 zombies into the Game class' playField and displaying it from the GameToGui class
- You can generate the second required event related to adding Xs to a Y by using that same instance as above.
    Input a number from 0-9 (preferably 0) and press the "Place Flower" button right below it to add a flower onto the playField
- You can locate my visual component by launching MainGui. It will launch the main menu with a background image (yes that's minecraft)
- You can save the state of my application by pressing the save button after launching the game instance
    (play/load button in the main menu)
- You can reload the state of my application by pressing the load button in the main menu
